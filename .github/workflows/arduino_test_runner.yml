          #  behavior of arduino_ci is to assume that "if the files don't
          #  exist, then they were not MEANT to exist".  In other words,
          #  if you were to accidentally delete all your tests or example
          #  sketches, then the CI runner would by default assume that was
          #  intended and return a passing result.
          #
          # If you'd rather have the test runner fail the test in the
          #  absence of either tests or examples, uncommenting either of
          #  the following lines (as appropriate) will enforce that.
